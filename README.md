Check into this repository the files you use to manage GQCG software that aren't suitable for distribution in the main repository, whether for reasons of machine-specificity or rare use or otherwise. Also files that other developers should be aware of so 'auto-procedures' can be traced.

See README.md files in subdirectories for specific notes.
